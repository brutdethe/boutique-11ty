description: >
    This 高山茶 - GāoShānChá (high mountain tea) is one of the emblematic 烏龍 - WūLóng teas of 臺灣 - Táiwān. 梨山 - LíShān is located in 臺中市 - TáiZhōng and has an average altitude of 2000 meters.<!--more--> There are only two harvests per year. Due to the large difference in temperature between day and night, the tea grows slowly and the leaves are thicker. In the mountains, with persistent clouds and mist, the duration of sunlight is short, which reduces the catechin content and thus the astringency.
