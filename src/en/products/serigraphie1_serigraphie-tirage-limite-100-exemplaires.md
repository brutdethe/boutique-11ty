description: >
    A variation of the first poster of the festival to frame the image of our collective: Brut de Thé. The Chinese translation is not literal at all, it is an assumed choice that could be interpreted as -the soul of tea-.<!--more--> Each piece is unique, they have been carefully printed by Delphine Chapuis in Saint-Étienne and are checked and signed by the author.
